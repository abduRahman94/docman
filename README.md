# docman
Docman is a full stack document management system, complete with roles and privileges. It creates a restful API for users to create and manage documents and it also provides admin priviledges.

## Development
* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - Flask is a BCD licensed microframework for Python based on Werkzeug and Jinja 2.
* [Flask-Migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - This an extension that handles SQLAlchemy database migrations for Flask applications using Alembic. The database operations are made available through the Flask command-line interface.
* [Flask-Script](https://flask-script.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - This extension provides support for writing external scripts in Flask. This includes running a development server, a customized Python shell, scripts to set up a database and other command-line tasks that belong outside the web application itself.
* [Flask-SQLAlchemy](http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/2.1/) - This extension help to simplify using SQLAlchemy with Flask by providing useful defaults and extra helpers that make it easier to accomplish common tasks.
* [Python-Env](https://github.com/mattseymour/python-env) - This library allows the saving of environment variables in .env and loaded when the application runs.

## Application Features
###### User Authentication
Users are authenticated and validated using an `itsdangerous` token. Generating tokens on login ensures each account is unique to a user and can't be accessed by an authenticated user.
    
## API Documentation
Docman exposes its data via an Application Programming Interface (API), so developers can interact in a programmatic way with the application. This document is the official reference for that functionality.
